				<p className="font-semibold">
					Basket Buddy is a 'smart' shopping list application, that enables you
					to customize your shopping experience the more you use it over time!
					<br />
					When a user indicates a purchase has been made, the application will
					maintain that status for 24 full hours, enabling you to make sure that
					every item on the list has been obtained - even through multiple
					visits. You might also want to share a full list with others - Basket
					Buddy enables that easily!
